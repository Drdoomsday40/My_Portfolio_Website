            <p class="intro" id="intro">
                I have always possessed a deep desire to work with back-end software development including algorithms, data structures, and machine learning. My ultimate goal is to achieve a role in Full Stack Development. I provide strong leadership coaching to software engineers as a peer mentor or manager. I've learned to communicate complex concepts in terms everyone can understand whether technical or business environments. I greatly enjoy developing high-trust relationships in staff meetings and project facilitation that also assists in maintaining the projects' bottom line.
